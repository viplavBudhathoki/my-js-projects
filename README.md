My JavaScript Projects

This repository contains my journey of learning and revising JavaScript from scratch to advanced. I am practicing step by step – strengthening my basics, solving problems, and gradually building projects to prepare for React.js and real-world applications.

Progress:
- Day 1: Variables, Data Types, Operators, Console.log, Objects, Arrays and Mini Login Form
- Day 2: Functions (declaration, expression, arrow functions), Conditional Statements (if/else, switch, ternary), 
         Loops (for, while, for...of, for...in, do...while, break, continue), and a Mini Calculator Project (using functions and conditionals).
- Day 3: Strings & String Methods, Numbers & Math (round, floor, ceil, pow, sqrt, random), Mini Projects 
         (Word Counter, Guess the Number Game, and Calculator with basic operations)
- Day 4: Arrays Deep Dive - Array Basics, Accessing Elements, Mutating & Non-Mutating Methods (push, pop, splice, slice, concat,
         spread), Iteration Methods (forEach, map, filter, reduce), Searching (find, findIndex, includes), Sorting, Copying Arrays, and Practice Exercises (remove duplicates, squares, filtering/sorting users, flatten nested arrays).
- Day 5: Revision of Day 3 & Day 4 (Strings, Arrays & Objects)
- Day 6: Objects Deep Dive – Properties, Methods, `this` keyword, Nested Objects, Object.keys(), Object.values(), Object.entrie(),
         Looping through Objects, Arrays of Objects, and Copying Objects using Spread Operator.
- Day 7: Day 7: Revision & Practice – Objects recap (properties, methods, this, nested objects, loops, 
         Object.keys/values entries), shallow vs deep copy, bind() usage, and a Bank Account mini project.


Goals:
- Build a strong foundation in JavaScript 
- Strengthen and revise previously learned concepts
- Create small projects for practice
- Move into React.js with confidence
- Use this repo to track my progress and share with others

Technologies:
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
- HTML, CSS (for UI practice)

This repo is my coding practice diary. Follow along as I learn, revise, and improve every day.
