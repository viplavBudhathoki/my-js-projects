My JavaScript Projects

This repository contains my journey of learning and revising JavaScript from scratch to advanced. I am practicing step by step â€“ strengthening my basics, solving problems, and gradually building projects to prepare for React.js and real-world applications.

Progress:
- Day 1: Variables, Data Types, Operators, Console.log, Objects, Arrays and Mini Login Form

Goals:
- Build a strong foundation in JavaScript
- Strengthen and revise previously learned concepts
- Create small projects for practice
- Move into React.js with confidence
- Use this repo to track my progress and share with others

Technologies:
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
- HTML, CSS (for UI practice)

This repo is my coding practice diary. Follow along as I learn, revise, and improve every day.
